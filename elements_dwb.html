									<h2>Design proposals for exploring digital well-being.</h2>
									<h3>Stakeholders - Designers of video-streaming platforms.</h3>

									<h3>Compulsive binge-watching habit</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/dis2_habitLoop.png" alt="" /></span>Binge-watching videos has become not only a topic of social interation but also an ever-increasing addiction with the availability of easy internet access and ubiquitous computing. Data consumption has drastically increased specifically because of this reason in the last decade. The side effects of such an addiction vary from various physiological effects such as blurry eyes, loss of stamina and increased heart attack chances to psychological effects such as anxiety, depression etc.. With the video content getting more and more compelling each day, season producers are releasing their episodes all at once for people to indulge in, while the algorithms behind the recommended suggestions reinforce the likes and desires of users, making this a vicious cycle of compulsive behavior that gets embedded in the binge watchers viewing habits. We wanted to explore if the design of UI elements had an effect on enhancing the binge-watching behavior among the other known factors.</p>

										<hr />

									<p>The study involved dour stages.
									<ol>
										<li>An exploratory study that confirmed the hypothesis, i.e. UI of video streaming apps is responsible for aggravating the binge-watching behaviour.</li>
										<li>An online diary study that revealed the patterns of state of mind and moods of users while interacting with UI of video streaming platforms.</li>
										<li>Characterization of UI dark patterns in popular video streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, PrimeVideo and Youtube.</li>
										<li>Formulation of design suggestions that can help in safeguarding unintended behaviors of compulsive viewing due to popular features like Autoplay and Recommendations.</li>
									</ol>

									</p>

									<h3>General survey</h3>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dis1_Survey_Correlations2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Initially, a general exploratory survey questionnaire seeking an insight on factors and reasons responsible for augmenting and promoting excessive video watching, conducted on 180 participants, revealed the viewing behaviour of university level Indian population. The questions asked were a mix of objective-type, likert-scale rating based, and subjective-types, seeking self-reporting of participants on their viewing behaviour. A correlation was drawn on the factors promoting binge-watching like content, UI of the streaming platform, psychological factors, contextual factors, social factors etc. with the negative feelings of guilt, anxiety etc. usually followed at the end of a binge-watching session. Around 75 % participants agreed that UI plays at least some part in augmenting the binge-watching behaviour. This gave us confidence to proceed and further research on the exact role of user interface in promoting binge watching.</p>

									<p>After a thorough psychology literature survey, we came up with a comprehensive framework of knowledge base in behavioral psychology related to digital well-being that was used to exploit the exact elements of user interface design on Youtube and Netflix and the user viewing behavior related thereof, through a semi-structured open-ended interview. To find out detailed insights on the exact triggers in UI that cause a person to watch more than recommended, we took a range of users who varied in their binge watching experience on the basis of time limits in 4 brackets i.e. 1 to 3 hours, 3 to 5 hours, 5 to 7 hours, and 7 hours and more. The users were either asked or shown the exact user interface design instance and asked to reflect on their experiences of binge-watching while doing the interview. The study revealed that features like autoplay, animated thumbnails on hover, recommendations, trending, infinite scroll, skip credits, skip intro, though useful initially, with time induce negative cycles of compulsion by taking away the user autonomy, increasing the fear of missing out, and enhancing choice paralysis.</p>

									<h3>Dark patterns</h3>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dis3_DPTable.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>A dark pattern, coined by Harry Brignull in 2010, is defined as
									"a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users
									into doing things... they are not mistakes, they are carefully
									crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and
									do not have the userâ€™s interests in mind". We found out that there was a lot of scope to recognise dark patterns in product designs, especially as seen from the end-user behavior in practice. Following in the works of previous activists like Harry Brignull who coined the term dark patterns, we introduced a definition of dark patterns as seen from the perspective of long term behaviour in terms of video watching. We propose that while these features are useful, these features ought to have safeguard measures in long term from a user-centric design philosophy or they should be classified as dark.

									Following are the five 5 dark patterns on video streaming platforms -
									<ol>

									<li>``Feature fog'' refers to UI patterns that induce unawareness by reducing autonomy of monitoring user time spent.</li>

									<li>``Extreme countdown'' refers to UI patterns that have a timer and that execute automatically if not interrupted within the short period of time.</li>

									<li>``Switchoff delay'' refers to UI patterns that promote strategies of hiding restrictive usage features in the default UI</li>

									<li>``Attention quicksand'' refers to UI patterns that instantly start without conscious user action.</li>

									<li>``Bias grind'' refers to UI patterns that disproportionately overload user interests and biases</li>
									</ol>

										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dis4_ABW-UIPatters.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>

									We presented a grave issue concerning the current state of design on these online platforms which disrupted qualities of user digital wellbeing like self control and autonomy and led them towards a negative or guilt-laden experience. In the short-term, users enjoy the benefits of convenience, ease of access, and compelling design of the display. However, as participants continually
									mentioned, the long-term effects are mostly ill because of the negative dependencies created by such designs.

									<h3>Design proposals on YouTube</h3>
									
									<p>Following from the previous studies, we realized the need to come up with design proposals for raising awareness on the minimal costs involved in inculcating digital well-being variables as traded off against engagement variables in interface design. We defined an exhaustive list of 7 strategies from design feature analysis of previous studies, factors promoting binge-watching and workaround solutions currently employed by users to achieve digital well-being. Each of these seven strategy instances were shown and designed with minimal intrusion to the existing design features of YouTube.
									<ol>

									<li>Autoplay nudges - Since autoplay enforced a drastic (24.8\%) increase in mindless behaviors with the progression of viewing duration in a video session, design safeguards like nudges (Cox et al, 2016) could be particularly useful in prompting a user to make a conscious interaction before continuing to watch more videos.</li>

									<li>Conscious default UI interactions - The only options available in Autoplay while video watching a series are `Watch Credits' and `Play Next'. While currently the default option for video watching is selecting `Play Next' after a brief amount of time, the default option could instead be changed to `Skip Credits' and then require a conscious interaction in order to begin playing the next episode of the series.</li>

									<li>Varied recommendations - Netflix is a good case in point for other video streaming platforms in that it tries to maintain categories and introduce varied Recommendations that users can choose from. By effectively categorizing personalized recommendations, the platform helps the user in making a decision resulting in well informed and better utilization of their engagement times with the platform.</li>

									<li>Alternative recommendation nudges - Since suggesting new recommendations currently work on providing video options that extend the user interests and biases over the previous watching history, design safeguards that timely refresh Recommendations randomly and provide nudges for introducing something new after a particular threshold of Recommendations might be helpful to break out of the set list of options that users are engaged in. This can help expose them to new personal interests, potentially enhancing and broadening their interests and moods, thereby reducing mindless viewing.</li>

									<h3>Quote</h3>
									<blockquote>Clearly, one can't deny that autoplay is useful, but it does take away the time from you to think what to watch next or whether to watch or not, and when it just starts, you just give in to the choice made for you.</blockquote>
