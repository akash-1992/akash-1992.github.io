									<h2>Problem</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/dis2_habitLoop.png" alt="" /></span>Binge-watching videos has become not only a topic of social interation but also an ever-increasing addiction with the availability of easy internet access and ubiquitous computing. Data consumption has drastically increased specifically because of this reason in the last decade. The side effects of such an addiction vary from various physiological effects such as blurry eyes, loss of stamina and increased heart attack chances to psychological effects such as anxiety, depression etc. With the video content getting more and more compelling each day, season producers are releasing their episodes all at once for people to indulge in, making users more prone to reacting to triggers of loneliness, boredom etc., which makes them end up watching more videos than they would like for short-term gratification. This makes it a vicious cycle of compulsive user behavior that gets embedded in the binge watchers' viewing habits. We wanted to explore if the design of UI elements had an effect on enhancing the binge-watching behavior.</p>

									<hr />
									<br>
									<br>

									<h2>Problem Exploration</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/DSC_3653.JPG" alt="" /></span>Initially, we conducated an exploratory survey questionnaire among 180 university students aged 18-25 years. The questionnaire contained multiple choice objective questions related to video watching. We came up with a list of factors that cause general addiction (fear of missing out, loneliness, while relaxing, habit formation) and augmented it with factors that are specific to binge-watching from existing literature, including “ease of access of digital me- dia” and “power of compelling content”. We also conducted open-ended semi-structured interviews with 12 of the survey respondents to get more in-depth insights. The questions encouraged users to introspect about the way they watch, focusing on how and why they used certain features and ignored others. Figure 2 summarizes the results of the study. While compelling content was found to be the most significant factor, ease of access (SD 0.735, p<0.0001) and habit formation (0.420, p<0.0001) were two other significant contributors that promoted binge-watching. 75% of users felt that ease of access to video content and viewing habits promoted by Autoplay and Recommendations led to excessive viewing. Further, 90% of users also confessed that they often exceeded their planned watching times. We found that people who did so experienced negative emotions, felt higher levels of regret, procrastinated, and were dissatisfied immediately following the excessive viewing session. In the figure below, redder/warmer colors indicate higher correlation, while bluer/cooler are inversely correlated.</p>

									<h2>Study Details</h2>
									<p style="width:680px">After conducting the intital exploratory survey, we decided to focus our efforts on finding habitual human behaviors, while using context and type of UI interaction used as prompts at various temporal satges of video watching. The study involved four stages.
									<ol>
										<li style="width:680px">An online diary study that revealed the patterns of state of mind and moods of users while interacting with UI of video streaming platforms.</li>
										<li style="width:680px">Interviews with participants based on a selected set of problematic artifacts to come up with a taxonomization of UI dark patterns in popular video streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, PrimeVideo and Youtube.</li>
										<li style="width:680px">Formulation of theoritical design suggestions from existing literature and interview insights that can help in safeguarding unintended behaviors of compulsive viewing due to popular features like Autoplay and Recommendations.</li>
										<li style="width:680px">This was further augmented by an ethical discussion highlighting implications of such UI dark patterns on user behaviors and their potential consequences, calling attention to the need for laying stress on digital well-being in the design for long-term sustainable user behaviors.</li>
									</ol>

									<br>
									<h2>Structure of Online Diary Study</h2>
									<p style="width:680px">
									Dual Process Theory acts as our framework to investigate thinking patterns and user perceptions in video watching as it is intended to reveal both conscious (controlled, mindful) and unconscious (automatic, mindless) thinking patterns, as manifested in user viewing behaviors when interacting with UI features to navigate to the next video in a session. This is done by providing options that display an equal number of mindful/conscious states of mind, mindless/unconscious states of mind, and an option in between them for each UI interaction. Further, our online diary contains prompts for participants to reflect on their use of UI features, the context (place, time, social setting), feelings (satisfaction, regret, or somewhere in between) and their state of mind (mindful, mindless, or somewhere in between).

										</div>
									</div>

									<br>
									<br>
									<p style="width:680px">To capture user affect, we provide 12 categories of distinct positive and negative emotions in equal numbers that are relevant to video watching as options, following the approach used in the PANAS scale. We also include one neutral emotion so as to span all emotional valences. Motivated by the SAM pictorial scale, we represented each emotion with a different cartoon graphic so that users could quickly make decisions regarding their perceived emotions.</p>

									<h2>Results of Online Diary Study</h2>
									<p style="width:680px">We define two stages which are important to analyze in a video watching session, the <i>video selection (interaction) phase</i> and the <i>video completion phase</i>. 
									<br>
									<br>


									<p style="width:680px"><b>Video Selection phase - </b>We refer to video selection phase as the phase where users interact with the UI features of streaming platform to select a video for viewing. We use this for analyzing user state of mind.</p>

									<ul>
										<li style="width:680px"> As observed from Figure 1(a), as users move from the first 2 videos towards the last 2, or as users move from the start of a viewing session towards the end, the percentage of people who view videos mindlessly increases by 24.8% in Autoplay, as compared to the percentage increase in mindless viewing due to Recommendations, which is 3.5%.</li>

										<br>

        							<div>
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dis5_Combined_Ease_Autonomy_Mindless.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
										<br>
        
        
        								<li style="width:680px"> As users move from the start of a viewing session towards the end, they move from liking a video suggestion on Autoplay, to mindlessly letting it play, and finally to a margin of uncertainty (somewhere between liking the Autoplay suggestion to mindlessly using it) (Figure 2(a)). The interviews revealed two explanations for this. Firstly, most Autoplay suggestions were used by users to complete a story in a series (continuous content format of story development over multiple episodes). Therefore, even if the user did not like a story, they watched the video so that a closure could be achieved.
        								<br>
        								<br>

        								<h3>Quotes</h3>
										<blockquote style="width:680px">''5 seconds left on Autoplay and then you’re like never mind, it has started already. I can’t stop it because once the content starts and I’m about to cancel or exit, it feels like you’re leaving it midway. There’s this strange feeling of missing out on something. It's only later when you have lost a lot of time that you realize that I had no reason to complete the video, maybe other than to watch how the story ends.''</blockquote>
										
										<blockquote style="width:680px">''Secondly, while watching a series, users did not have enough time in the Autoplay timer to pause to reflect and discuss about the recently concluded episode of a story clearly, or to make a conscious decision to stop watching. P8 said, "Watching credits should be default action when one is watching a story. An episode usually finishes at a watershed moment, which requires thinking and discussions with fellow watchers, which are arguably denied by Autoplay after conclusion of an episode. Honestly, this could be avoidable. It ruins the viewing experience.''</blockquote>
										</li>

										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dis6_OddsRatio_graphs.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
										</div>
        								<li style="width:680px">As users move from the start of a viewing session toward the end of a viewing session, they move from a margin of uncertainty, to liking a video suggestion through Recommendations, and finally to mindlessly selecting a Recommendation suggestion (Figure 2(a)). The interviews revealed that this might be because most users at the start of the session were not sure of which Recommended video to select in the selection phase. But since Recommendations continuously keeps recommending on the basis of previous watching history after completing each video, people start liking the suggestions as it starts matching their current mood.
        								<br>
        								<br>

        								<h3>Quotes</h3>
										<blockquote style="width:680px">''Recommendations are good to get started with. I get to choose the topic of the videos that I have watched currently.''</blockquote>

										However, towards the end of a viewing session, users are usually exhausted and bored with the presented Recommendations.
										<br>
										<br>

										<blockquote style="width:680px">''As you keep selecting the videos from Recommendations in YouTube, it feels like a rabbit hole, you start disliking the viewing experience. I mean it might be good to have a wider range of recommendations at times, like Netflix does.''</blockquote>
									</li>
        							</ul>


        							<p style="width:680px"><b>Video Completion phase - </b>We refer to video completion phase as the phase where users conclude watching a video. We use this for analyzing user feelings.</p>

        							<ul>
        								<div>
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/dis7_combined_satisfaction_regret_graph.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<br>
        								<li style="width:680px">As observed from Figure 3(a), unplanned viewers who tend to extend their viewing sessions increase chances of feeling regret by 34.02% while using Recommendations. The percentage increase in regret due to Autoplay is 19.8%. Although the percentage increase for both Autoplay and Recommendations are high here, the percentage increase in regret due to Recommendations is much higher and much more problematic.</li>
        								<br>
        
        
        								<li style="width:680px">As users move from the start of a viewing session towards the end of a viewing session, there are two most prominent feelings after finishing a video selected using Autoplay. One is a feeling of dissatisfacton due to content and regret of over-watching the amount of content. Second is  satisfacton of content but regret of over-watching the amount of content (Figure 2(b)). This result was very significant in our findings. The interviews revealed that the reason behind this could be Autoplay's way of working while users view a series, which is to continuously enforce content to users that they like and force them to watch back to back episodes in a season until they finish the entire season off. </li>

        								<br>

        								<h3>Quotes</h3>
										<blockquote style="width:680px">''It's almost predatory, you can't have any discussions with family or friends, you hardly get any time to interact with the UI in the limited timer, and there you go, another episode starts.''</blockquote>


        
        								<li style="width:680px">As users move from the start of a viewing session towards the end of a viewing session, the most prominent feeling after finishing a video selected using Recommendations is dissatisfaction due to the content watched along with over-watching (Figure 2(b)). This result was very significant in our findings. We also observed that the odds of an extended session is more when a user uses Recommendation than Autoplay, as a user moves from the start to the end of a session. Hence, we conclude that Recommendations causes more regretful extended viewing sessions than Autoplay as with Autoplay suggestions the user watches the desired content which is not the case with Recommendation suggestions. The interviews revealed that this might be because of undesired Recommendations which people end up watching and eventually wasting time on.</li>
        								<br>
        								<h3>Quotes</h3>
										<blockquote style="width:680px">''I usually watch the series recommended by a friend or which is trending, so I don't have to go through the Recommended videos.''</blockquote>

										<blockquote style="width:680px">''Just because the medium is easy to use, and not as hard to get onto as maybe reading a book, its easy to just start watching whatever Recommendation you get. Its the best time pass, but usually I feel like I could have watched something better, or maybe have done something more productive.''</blockquote>

									<h2>Dark patterns</h2>

									<p style="width:680px">A dark pattern, coined by Harry Brignull in 2010, is defined as
									"a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users
									into doing things... they are not mistakes, they are carefully
									crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and
									do not have the user’s interests in mind". We found out that there was a lot of scope to recognise dark patterns in product designs, especially as seen from the end-user behavior in practice. Following in the works of previous activists like Harry Brignull who coined the term dark patterns, we introduced a definition of dark patterns as seen from the perspective of long term behaviour in terms of video watching. We propose that while these features are useful, these features ought to have safeguard measures in long term from a user-centric design philosophy or they should be classified as dark.

									</div>
								
									<br>
									<br>
								
									<div class="inner">
									<p style="width:680px">All the researchers then] presented their findings on each UI element across the 4 platforms - YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar and Amazon Prime Video over the 3 types of viewing platforms - mobile/tablet devices, laptop/PC and television, and worked together to identify problematic UI elements. Finally, every researcher independently confirmed that all formulated categories were appropriate. The goal of this categorization process was to reveal certain situations of use and their consequent effect on a user’s state of mind. For example, ‘extreme countdown’ not only represented the timer in an Autoplay functionality, but also the pressure situation induced by it for the users to make a decision. We arrived at a total of 44 UI artifact instances. These are highlighted in the following figure through the red marked icons.

									<p style="width:680px">After conducting with a mix of randomly chosen self-reported bingers and regular viewers in the following categories: 0-3 hrs (3), 3-5 hrs (4), 5-7 hrs (4), and 7+ hrs (4), we came up with the following 5 dark patterns on video streaming platforms -</p>

									<h2>Theoritical Design Proposals on YouTube</h2>
									
									<p style="width:680px">Following from the previous studies and existing literature, we realized the need to come up with design proposals that can act as active safeguards on the current UI of video streaming platforms ehich could potentially help in reducing unnecessary obsessive and compulsive user behaviors.

													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>T2</td>
														<td>Conscious default UI interaction</td>
														<td>The default option could be changed from 'Play Next' to `Skip Credits' and then require a conscious interaction in order to begin playing the next episode of the series.</td>

														<td>By effectively categorizing personalized recommendations, platforms can help the user in making a decision resulting in well informed and better utilization of their engagement times with the platform.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>T4</td>
														<td>Alternative recommendation nudges</td>
														<td>Design safeguards that timely refresh Recommendations randomly and provide nudges for introducing something new after a particular threshold of Recommendations might be helpful to break out of the set list of options that users are engaged in.</td>

									<h2>Need for Digital Well-Being as a Variable for Sustainable Design</h2>
									<p>
									<p style="width:680px">We present the 5 categories of dark patterns to highlight and raise awareness on the current state of design on online video streaming platforms which disrupt aspects of user digital wellbeing, like self control and autonomy, and lead them towards a negative or guilt-laden experience. In the short-term, users enjoy the benefits of convenience, ease of access, and compelling design of the display. However, as participants continually
									mentioned, the long-term effects are mostly detrimental to their wellbeing because of the negative dependencies created by such designs.
									<br>
									<br>
									We notice that dark patterns are designed from the same psychological rulebooks that are used to enhance ease of use. However, a usable design does not always imply an ethical one. The pervasiveness of these designs makes it harder to spot, coercing users to continue using these patterns. Therefore, this calls for defining ethical boundaries of persuasion and deception along with a more meaningful public discourse regarding ethics and condemning these designs by making the practicing commu- nity more aware of how persuasion through ease of use techniques may turn “dark” [55]. We need to re-evaluate ease of use as not just providing convenient functionality rather how it affects us as individuals.
									<br>
									<br>
									Apart from identifying mindless and regretful behaviors in in- dividuals, our work has several social implications as well. Since video watching is also done as a group activity with family and friends, it serves as a cultural artifact that needs to be ideally cu- rated as it has the power to modify social behaviors. If enough space is not provided to a group of people while video watching to talk and interact, for example when skipping credits and playing next episode, it might ruin the viewing experience and result in non-communicative unhealthy social behaviors. This again raises importance of designing the default UI of these platforms in a way that supports active disengagement from the platform, whenever required, to encourage healthy usage in long-term.
