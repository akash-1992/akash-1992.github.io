									<p style="width:680px">I worked on this project with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manshulbelani/?originalSubdomain=in">Manshul V. Belani</a> (pursuing Ph. D. under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanparnami/?originalSubdomain=in">Dr. Aman Parnami</a>) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/namanm17/?originalSubdomain=in">Naman Maheshwari</a> (intern at Weave Lab). Manshul was responsible for providing assistive literature review on the work alongside providing technical expertise on the user study methods. Naman was responsible for getting his hands dirty and building the app based on the inputs of team discussions. Dr. Aman Parnami was the advisor for the work.</p>

										<li style="width:680px">I was the team lead for the project.</li>
										<li style="width:680px">I realized the need for an educational tool in the lives of people who have English as second language.</li>
										<li style="width:680px">I read the related work and found a gap in existing literature that we can leverage to make an educational tool that is novel and effective, i.e. a tool that teaches why, how and when to speak something.</li>
										<li style="width:680px">I designed all the user studies after consultation with fellow team members and Dr. Parnami, the project advisor.</li>
										<li style="width:680px">I was responsible for coding the backend logic of the algorithm in python on which the system runs.</li>

									<h2>Problem</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/DSC_3085_bright.jpg" alt="" /></span>The style of English speaking in populations where the native language is not English, is a problem. People in these areas tend to speak English in the same style as their native language. For example, Hindi is a syllable-timed language and Hindi speaking people who have English as their second language (ESL), tend to speak English in a syllable-timed manner. English, however is supposed to be spoken in a stress-timed manner. A user study on the proof of concept revealed the importance such a tool can have on the lives of ESL speakers in terms of making them better public speakers and improving their communication skills.

									<h2>Solution - Intonations</h2>
									<p style="width:680px">A thorough literature survey revealed 4 intonations which are universally accepted across all types of English accents like Australian, British, American etc. and that have different contextual meanings. Each intonation had a different type of shape in terms of its pronunciation and different place in the sentence where it is pronounced. These intonations were modelled for practice in the final samrtphone app to teach why, when and how to pronounce intonations.</p>

									<h2>Proof of Concept Test - Cue Card Study</h2>
									<p ><span class="image right"><img src="images/DSC_3064_bright.jpg" style="background-color:white" alt="" /></span><p style="width:680px">The cue card study was done with 10 participants, all selected from the university campus through emails. The app was designed to engage the user in a conversation with a chat agent called Verbose (simulated by the designer in the cue card study). The participant and the designer had to role play the conversations alternatively. Each participant was supposed to speak the same sentence three times, but each time with different contexts. Each participant went through the entire procedure after consenting to the study. The change in performance was calculated before and after the cue card training to validate the teaching pedagogy. Along with this, the recordings of individual participants were recorded and later checked on the Praat software for observations that could be transferred to the final smartphone app. <!--<span class="image left"><img src="images/Fig4.png" alt="" /></span>--></p></p>

									<h2>Low-fidelity Prototype Testing</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/DSC_3075_bright.jpg" alt="" /></span><p style="width:680px">A think-aloud approach informed the basic app structure, with useful interactions in the learning process, relevant information to be displayed and the complete app flow. 10 participants were selected from the university by sending out emails about the testing of a voice-based learning app. Open coding the think aloud sessions of the participants on sketch-based mockups of the app usage gave us five categorical emergent themes. First was clear demarcation of the different app phases. This prompted us to include section wise distinctions of the various app phases, namely, instructions, pre training, training, post training and analysis phases, which were clearly mentioned through a splash screen in the app. Second was graphical representation of the analysis phase for a less cluttered and less cognitively-loaded mode of display, which initially was only textual. This was incorporated in the final app development through two types of graphs showing the progress made in terms of the individual intonations learned and the total change in performance score as compared from the pre-training phase.</p></p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/more pics/interact (1) (1).jpg" alt="" /></span>Third was section wise feedbacks on the training screens within the training phase for reinforcing the learning process that improves intonations. This was included in the final smartphone app development through constant pop-up feedback interactions and feedback screens after each training screen. Fourth was cues on the interaction details in the training screens, with ways to display the minimum number of tries, bonus attempts and hints. The minimum number of tries and bonus attempts were incorporated in the final app through circular icons on the top right of each training screen with three different colors, red denoting the wrong attempt, green denoting the correct attempt and grey denoting the remaining attempts. Hints were denoted through a separate button on the bottom left of the screen denoting incremental hints with each try to successfully complete the training level trial. The final theme that emerged out of the user study was introducing each new intonation before the actual training session. This was incorporated through a splash screen at the beginning of each new introduced intonation. The low-fidelity study gave us five important feedbacks and helped us transfer the relevant design details to the final mobile-based app.</p>

									<p style="width:680px">A visual design expert along with 10 students from the visual design class were used to intuitively rate the closeness of the text written on the screen with the audio playback provided on an online link containing the relevant files and the response measurement form. All possible combinations of the options available to highlight text in a text editor like bold, underline, italics, highlight with the options available to show change in pitch modulation like change in text size and graphical representation above the text were presented to the users. 2 combinations among them were rated the most intuitive by the participants. Subjective feedbacks on the form helped us narrow the most intuitive representation as the one where the text color of the tonic units was the same as that of the tonic syllable, alongwith change in text size representing pitch modulation. Further, observations regarding the unintuitiveness of text italics and graph to highlight stress and change in stress, respectively were noted. This audio-visual user study was formalized after a thorough literature survey examining the various ways in which change in pitch has been represented historically while writing musical notes and tone sounds, finding an optimum way to read that does not disrupt the flow of reading and at the same time provides relevant sound related information clearly.</p>

									<h2>App Architecture</h2>
									<p style="width:680px">The figure below describes the system upon which the final high-fidelity app was built. Voice input from the user was recorded for analysis and sent to the server for content analysis. If a normal threshold accuracy for correctness was achieved, the audio was split into timeframes to get the exact part where the user intonated in a sentence. This was then pitch extracted using Parselmouth and analysed through a self constructed algorithm for checking intonation.</p>

									<h2>High-fidelity testing</h2>
									<p style="width:680px">A comprehensive evaluation on the final high-fidelity app across three sessions and in between the 4 phases of the app, namele, pre-training test, training, post-training test and analysis phases, was done using methods as shown below.

									<h3>UEQ (User Experience Questionnaire)</h3>
									<p style="width:680px">A UEQ questionnaire was conducted to find out the user reponses on features of the app involving attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation and novelty.</p>

									<h3>SUS (System Usability Scale)</h3>
									<p style="width:680px">The SUS scores were used to find the app usability. Any score above 80.3 (out of 100) on the SUS scale is among the top 10 percentile and correlates to the adjective rating of good. The overall user-friendliness of our app was rated 82.3 (out of 100) on SUS. The score was much above the required average benchmark score on SUS, which is 68. These results proved the hypothesis of our app in teaching the requisite English speaking skills. Quantitative analysis of learning gain across different intonation and across sessions revealed each result was statistically significant. Further, the percentage incorrect performance of the users was used to find the level of difficulty of each intonation. To further validate our findings and ground them in reason, these numbers were assisted from our qualitative findings of semi structured interviews conducted after session3 of the study.</p>

									<p style="width:680px">Qualitative observations revealed that all people found the skills taught to be useful in improving speech expressions. We conducted two-open ended semi-structured interviews with each participant. One in between the first session after the training phase to get insights on the feedbacks provided and learning methodology used for teaching. Other, after the end of complete study to get insights on the experience with the study. We inductively coded the themes and then, deductively coded all the interviews again, marking converging themes. People could readily relate to real life examples of efficient speakers who speak with the skills taught through the app. Not only could the participants understand the rationale behind the app, they could feel the change in themselves after the study. All participants pointed out the novelty of such an app in improving the language speaking skills of people with English as second language. Further, users got to know why, where and when to stress in sentences according to different contexts. Along with knowing about each intonation in depth and the reason behind the way they are spoken, participants also got factual knowledge for disambiguation between different intonations through the information on introduction and feedback pages. Most users were able to finish successive exercises in lesser number of tries. Apart from the visual representation and information provided on introduction and feedback screens, this was attributed by users to the audio recordings in the introduction and the practice screens, which got activated in the Bonus tries after n+1 (n being the total number of intonations) attempts, in the training section. Verbose recordings alongside user recordings on the same text towards the end in the Analysis section and the audio cues in the Training section helped most participants in self analysis of their current level of speech intonations. The app also helped participants in distinguishing intensity from pitch through the hints in the analysis section. </p>
